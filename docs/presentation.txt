Two step build process/Buildploy - presentation

- Build process - capistrano
- update code on servers and restart

Problems:
- More complexity - coffeescript/sass, asset pipeline,
building on servers
- Storing built files in source repo, bundled ruby gems

Solution:
- two step build process
- Separate repository for holding built source tree ready to be deployed

Benefits (project dependent):
- history of code actually deployed to servers
- server load decreases
- time to deploy decreases
- destructive build operations
- development builds
- files that do not need to be deployed can be removed from built tree

Buildploy - implementation in python
- Single configuration file in the project
- source repository
- destination build repository
- build command
- build can be run by a separate user

- Heroku - has a similar deployment process.
